Last year, a New Zealand woman became the first to receive a gene-editing treatment to permanently lower her cholesterol.The cholesterol-lowering treatment, developed by Verve Therapeutics, relies on a form of gene editing called base editing, or “CRISPR 2.0.”<br/><br/>

It’s a more targeted approach—instead of simply making cuts to shut off specific genes, scientists can now swap a single DNA base for another. Together, these newer forms of CRISPR could broaden the scope of gene editing to take on many conditions—not all of them genetic.<br/><br/>

Someday, people may have the option to add genes thought to protect against high blood pressure or certain diseases, to their genetic code.<br/><br/>
