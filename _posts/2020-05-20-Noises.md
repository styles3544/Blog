It's so quiet right now. I can hear the wind rushing past the closed window beside my bed, trying to get through it. Ticking of the clock and sound of insects. 


I can also hear the breathing of others in the neighbouring room indicating that they're already asleep.<br/><br/>


My eyes are also heavy which is, to be honest, unusual for me. It might be possible that I'm exhausted, as it was a long day with a lot of noises. 


Noises that can make you tired.
