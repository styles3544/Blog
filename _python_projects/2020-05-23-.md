Today I want to share my experience regarding games. And to be specific, Game Making.<br/><br/>



We all have played some kind of games in our life and from what I believe, we are still playing it at the moment too. Some of you 
might be thinking that I'm out of my mind and I need rest. But If I may ask you a question, why are you doing jobs and earning? - for survival, right? All the things we do in our daily lives, we do the same in the games too. We survive, we eat, we earn, we compete. Or to put it in another
 way, all the things we do in a game are the same as we do in our real lives. We are playing the game everyday and every second of our life.<br/><br/>
 
 


I don't know if u guys agree with my Game Theory but that is pretty much it. But the purpose of this post is not telling you about playing games.
The purpose is letting you know about making games or Game Making. <br/><br/>




It was a great experience for me making my very own first game of my life. While making a game of your own you come up against many problems
which you might have to solve. It doesn't stop there. After that, the challenge of implementing the solution to the problem is something which is just
as important as solving one. You must have realized it too if you have a game of your own. You can come up with many solutions for a single problem, but to understand all the solutions so that you can choose
the best and efficient one is another thing which you can learn by making games. It sure hones your thinking capabilities and problem solving skills.<br/><br/>





And after all that we can't forget the fun part of Game Making - playing it. You can play your game too.





By my experience of making games, I sure learned a lot. And I believe that you'll too. That's why I encourage you to make at least one
game in your life by yourself and I'm pretty sure that it will surely benefit you in one way or another, like it did to me. I got a new perspective
at the end of the process. And sure, a game of my own too. Give a star to my game by giving a star to my game repository if you liked my game, or my post. <br/><br/>
