## Steps to Reproduce

<br/>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

1. Get the code by forking and cloning the repository 

<br/>

2. Download the code t your local machine and open the folder named Script. 

<br/>

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/torun1.gif)

<br/>

3. Right click on script1.py file and select --> open with IDLE as shown below ( You will get this option if python is already installed in your pc )

<br/>

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/torun2.gif)

<br/>

4. Now select 'Run Module' from 'Run' option as shown in next step ( Make sure that you're connected to the internet before running the script ) <br/>

5. After clicking that one few windows might open like browser, and terminal window as shown below:
   ( After few seconds the browser will automatically close and you can see your results )

<br/>

<br/>


## Enhancements

Add, delete or edit code as per requirement to add certain enhancements/features like [Custom Search Feature](#Custom-Search-Feature).

   + Next episode synopsis
   + Airing or Completed/Finished
   + What are the Genres of any anime?
   + And many more.....

<br/>

> You can also host your python code online on [wayScript](https://wayscript.com/) and schedule it so that it'll run automatically 

![wayscript]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Annotation.png)


<br/>

### Custom Search Feature
<br/>

Added a custom search option by modifying the script so that Ii can look for a particular anime. You can also contribute to the code and add more such features to it.

I've provided the code for above in Script2 folder, with custom search code and pushbullet code, for more clarity.
