One day i was sitting with one of my friends, killing time and chitchatting, but it wasn't like always. He seemed to be having something on his mind for quite a while now, it was written on his face. He was thinking about something. So, i decided to ask him straight about what's going on. These were the words he said:<br/><br/>
"A dream? What is it? Is it about something you want? No. It's not about something you want, it's about something you can't have. Because, if you can have what you want then it won't be a dream anymore."
