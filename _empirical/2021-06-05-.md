Amidst everything else that was going on in the whole world, with this disease leaving footprints on each and almost every other person's lives, I couldn't believe that it'd be like this again. I never felt this kind of rushing in my body for almost two years now.<br/><br/>
Drops of rain grazing down my skin, lively noises among the sorrowful faces, calling out names, doing things that others would consider stupid; made me forget to think about whatever else was happening there around me except for that moment. Looking around felt stupid. Maybe it was. The time it happened, the place it happened, the people it happened with; nothing was planned. Everything was so uncertain that I'll never forget it.<br/><br/>
