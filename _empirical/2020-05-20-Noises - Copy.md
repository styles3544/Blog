A dream? What is it? Is it about something you want? No. It's not about something you want, it's about something you can't have. Because, if you can have what you want then it won't be a dream anymore.</br></br>
For me, I don't want anything. I just wanna live. But, will I be able to do that? Will I be able to just live? No. Because even just for a living I'll need food, the exigent demand of the human body, to survive. And for that, I'll need money. And for money, I'll have to provide something to the society or people in exchange for that, like any service or any meaning or value.</br></br>
So for me, just want to live is a dream. But doesn't that sound stupid? I mean, who dreams to just live? So, what is a dream? Is it something you want? Or something you can't have?
