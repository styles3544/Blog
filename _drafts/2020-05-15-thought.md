It's morning already and I didn't sleep, again. Was doing few things last night which ofcourse includes putting my time and energy in 
building this blog site of mine but there was also something which I had to complete. Time sure passes by fast.<br/><br/>


Feels like I spent whole night just by writing few lines of codes but tbh I know that I did more than that. I guess I can't argue about it as it's birds chirping and sun rising filling my whole room with light. Doesn't matter what I did last night, right?<br/><br/>


With the new morning sun, another day passed just like that. I feel a hope inside me to make the next one more productive. Hope I can.
Hope is a funny thing. It gives you strength to hold on and move forward even though you know that it's all a false assurance that we are feeding ourselves with, just to keep going.
