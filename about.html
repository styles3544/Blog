        I was scrolling the pages over the internet for ideas regarding how to write "About Me" page and on one page I found this, 
"You must be honest while writing about yourself", so now I'll be honest with you. Don't be too
quick to judge, I wasn't planning on lying earlier too. It was just I didn't know where to begin with.
        Let's start with who I am.</p>
<p id="para">        
I'm <b>Piyush Kumar</b>, you can call me <b>styles</b> too - hence the name of my blog. 
I'm just an ordinary guy who loves to do things he loves. Complicated, right? I'm also an otaku and that's why I've also dedicated a section of my blog for stuff related to anime as you can see.
With that being said I want to add few more things, like - I,m 19. Currently in college and if you're interested in knowing more about me then you can, by visiting my <a href="https://github.com/styles3544">Github</a>
profile. Which is also linked down at the bottom of the page below.</p>

As we move forward in life we face different situations and get to know about ourselves more. I've just started my journey as a web developer
and data scientist so it's just about time for me to know how far I can go. The idea behind this blog was to record my journey and share 
my experiences which might help others out there thinking about going down the same road.
