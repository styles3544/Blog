    I don't know where this Blog of mine is going to end up tbh. But the reason I started was maybe that at some point in time I wanted to start blogging. I wanted to be a writer to be more specific, or that's what I thought then.
        But I know now that I don't have what it takes to be one. I asked someone a question once that wouldn't it be best if we knew already what we're capable of, we won't have to waste our time in doing the things which we can't.
        " I don't think so. If we knew what we're capable of doing then we wouldn't even try to do things in the first place. Moreover, I don't think that there's any limit to anyone's capabilities. ", she replied. The words might not be exact but that was the kind of answer she gave me which turned my whole perspective around for a second there.

     I don't know who was right then but with time some things became more clearer over time from then till today. I thought that even though I didn't have what it takes to be a writer, an inborn talent, or something, but with constant practice and consistency maybe someday I will become one. But things don't work like that. You have to have 'the thing' it requires already in you somehow. I tried, remembering her words, thinking that 'trying' will make up for the inability but to no avail. I won't say that she was wrong. It's good to try things because if you don't then you would not be able to figure out if you want to do it or not. But for me, 'trying' has a different meaning altogether. I see 'trying' as a way of 'accepting our inabilities'. 
        I don't think that by constantly trying I'll become a writer someday. I think that people don't want to have regrets in their lives so even though they know that they're incapable of doing something, they still do it or at least try once and then accept their incompetence rather than accepting it from the start. Maybe trying gives them hope too.
