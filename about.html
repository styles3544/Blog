    The reason I started was maybe that at some point in time I wanted to start blogging. I wanted to be a writer, to be more specific; or that's what I thought then.
        But I know now that I don't have what it takes to be one. I asked someone a question once that wouldn't it be best if we knew already what we're capable of, we won't have to waste our time in doing the things which we can't.
    </br></br>"I don't think so. If we knew what we're capable of doing then we wouldn't even try to do things in the first place. Moreover, I don't think that there's any limit to anyone's capabilities.", she replied. The words might not be exact but that was the kind of answer she gave me which turned my whole perspective around for a second there.

        I don't know who was right then, but they say that things became more clearer over time. I hoped so.</p>
