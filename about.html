    Hey there! </br></br>
    I'm Piyush Kumar, aka styles. Currently, I'm pursuing my B.Tech degree in Mechanical Engineering from NIT Durgapur. 
    </br></br>I'm an aspiring Data Scientist and ML Engineer. My tech stack consists of python & its libraries like Pandas and NumPy, web scraping with Selenium and Beautifulsoup, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, CAD software - CatiaV5 & Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD, and Git. I am currently studying ML and trying to get better every day. I'm not the best python developer in town, but I know how to work my way around if faced with any problem related to the python programming language. I love to work with various technologies as it always amazes me how different technologies can complement each other to solve some really challenging problems.
