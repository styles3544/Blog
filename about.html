    Hey there! </br></br>
    I'm Piyush Kumar. Some of my friends also call me styles. Currently, I'm pursuing my B.Tech degree in Mechanical Engineering from NIT Durgapur. 
    </br></br>I'm an aspiring Data Scientist and ML Engineer. My tech stack consists of Python & its libraries like Pandas and NumPy, web scraping with Selenium and Beautifulsoup, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, CAD software - CatiaV5 & Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD, and Git. I am currently studying ML and trying to improve my skills regarding that. I'm not the best python developer but I love to work with python. I'm interested to work in multi-disciplinary fields using technologies to complement one another for solving some great problems.
